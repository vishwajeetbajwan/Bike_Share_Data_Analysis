# Bike-Share-Data_Analysis

## It is a part of Udacity Python Foundation Nanodegree.

### In this project, I have performed an exploratory data analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. We explore US bike share data from three different cities. We try to answer some questions regarding the usage of bikes, characteristics of users and type of trips duration.
